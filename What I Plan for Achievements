Hey Curtis, here's what I'm planning:

Achievements: each achievement has a name, a boolean telling whether or not it is already gotten, a reward in gold (small), a reward in
XP (size depending on how great the achievement is), and why you got that achievement (what it takes to get the achievement)

The achievements will be stored in a dictionary, for example:
achievements={'Consistent Shopper': [False, 2, 15, 'Buy 4 items'], 'Ambitions Hunter': [False, 5, 20, 'Kill 50 monsters']}
etc.

There will be a function that runs, say, at the end of every new cycle (when you wander or finish fighting a monster, or leave the shop,
etc) called something like checkForAchievements() and will go through a list of global variables and if statements and check to see if
any of the conditions for getting a NEW achievement have been met. If so, it will mark that achievement as gotten and reward you for
getting it.

Now, obviously, there will need to be new global variables, like a counter for how many monsters you have killed, etc so that this can work

If the player wants to view what achievements they have gotten (or haven't!) there will be functions that go through the dictionary and
display (print, in a neat way) all the achievements that have (or haven't) been gotten.

Anyway, that's my idea.
